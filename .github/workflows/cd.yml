    # In a real scenario, you would decode the Keystore from a secret here.
    # For now, we build a signed release APK using standard methods, 
    # relying on the build.gradle to access signing configs from env vars or properties if configured.
    # If not configured, this might fail or produce an unsigned APK depending on config.
    # Since the user asked for "downloadable release apk", we try to assembleRelease.
